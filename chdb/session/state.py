class Session:
    """
    Session will keep the state of query.
    If path is None, it will create a temporary directory and use it as the database path
    and the temporary directory will be removed when the session is closed.
    You can also pass in a path to create a database at that path where will keep your data.

    You can also use a connection string to pass in the path and other parameters.
    Examples:
        - ":memory:" (for in-memory database)
        - "test.db" (for relative path)
        - "file:test.db" (same as above)
        - "/path/to/test.db" (for absolute path)
        - "file:/path/to/test.db" (same as above)
        - "file:test.db?param1=value1&param2=value2" (for relative path with query params)
        - "file::memory:?verbose&log-level=test" (for in-memory database with query params)
        - "///path/to/test.db?param1=value1&param2=value2" (for absolute path)

    Connection string args handling:
        Connection string can contain query params like "file:test.db?param1=value1&param2=value2"
        "param1=value1" will be passed to ClickHouse engine as start up args.

        For more details, see `clickhouse local --help --verbose`
        Some special args handling:
        - "mode=ro" would be "--readonly=1" for clickhouse (read-only mode)

    Important:
        - There can be only one session at a time. If you want to create a new session, you need to close the existing one.
        - Creating a new session will close the existing one.
